# ai-hangman

Implementation of the Hangman word-game using Chat GPT-5.



## Overview

This is a version of the classic game of Hangman. A random word (from the game's list) is chosen. The word starts as empty underlined spaces - one space for each letter. You can guess using any of the 26 letters in the alphabet. If you guess all of the letters in a word, you'll win!



## Directions

On each turn, tap on the letter to guess. Just tap the letter - no need to hit Enter.

In each game, letters cannot be repeated. If you guess a letter in a game that has already been guessed, it is ignored.

If a guess matches one or more times in the word, it will show all instances of that letter in the word, in place.

If a guess does not match any letters, the hangman victim is built by one piece. One by one, pieces are added to the victim: the head, body, two arms, and two legs. When there have been six missing guesses, all six pieces will be shown, and the player loses.

If they guess all letters in word, the player wins.

If you do not like the color used in the game, click on dropdown menu in the upper-right corner. You can choose a different color there.


## Details

There are 500 different words to guess in the game. Every word has 6 to 10 letters. There are at least 5 different letters used in each word. Words are all of reasonably common use (Top 5000 used). Most are common words; there are some proper (aka capitialized) nouns.


## Mobile

This game is supported on a mobile tablet. This game is playable, but with UI flaws, on a smartphone.

When playing on a mobile device, a keyboard with the letter A to Z will appear to allow the player to make guesses. When the game is over (win or lose), there will be a visible button to press on the screen to start a new game.

You can play on a smartphone. The screen size does not fit the game well. The keyboard might look odd. The letters you are guessing might not all be shown. It is playable; my apologies if you find it frustrating.
