version 1	8 minute dev	<1 minute code gen	9 minute test		18 minutes total

Notes v1: there are a lot of elements present that I did not specify. The initial game was playable
as-is. 


version 2	4 minute dev	<1 minute code gen	6 minute test		29 minutes total

Issues changed: apparent typo. Says Commodore 64. Intended is Commodore PET.
Issues changed: There are only 6-ish words. I want to add rules for the types of words that can be chosen.
Notes v2: The UI has changed a bit more than expected. I wouldn't expect the 64->PET name change to 
do something like that. For sure I wouldn't expect the word list to affect the UI. Changes are not
massive, but they're not subtle either. There are blocks around the hang post, the word you're guessing,
and the letters you have guessed. The guess has a block AND each letter has a block. I think I need to
be specific about this. It does do the guessed letters in alphabetical order, which I do like.
This also added "press enter to play again" which I like... without prompt mind you.
2nd word was LONGERTHA! That for sure is not a top 5000 word... or a word at all?


version 3	11 minute dev	3 minute code gen	6 minute test		49 minutes total

Issues changed: a lot! I did a restart of the ChatGPT session. I need to add a lot of detail to
get it back to the original look. For truly new details, I ask for guessed letters to be shown
in alphabetical order, and to better lay out the guess letters.
There are some changes to make, but this is very close.


version 4	6 minutes dev	3 minute code gen	3 minute test		1 hour 1 min total

This was quick and easy... but minor. The lineup of the words is centered, both vertically and
horizontally. It is good. Minor UI changes are made... it's the nature of the tool.


version X	7 minutes dev	4 minute code gen	3 minute test		1 hour 15 min total

DID NOT PROCEED - RETURNING TO VERSION 4 ON NEXT ATTEMPT
Two changes. 1) increased words from 100 to 200. 2) move the end of the game UI below the guessed 
letters. The initial new list had multiple bugs: words ending in 1, words with a lower-case number.
It offered a prompt to implement with a specific library. I tried it. Before generating code, the 
following question itself contained typos. I updated the word list to try again. It appeared to try
it, and totally changed the UI. Reverted, and just updated the end of game UI.


version 5	2 minutes dev	1 minute code gen	2 minute test		1 hour 20 min total

Trying more simple changes at a time. This time, just make the end of game appear below the guessed
letters. This worked, as expected, for when player wins or loses. I will commit and move one!


version 6	4 minutes dev	1 minute code gen	2 minute test		1 hour 27 min total

Same as last time, simple changes. Today, remove underlines for correctly guessed letters. First
change worked!


version 7	8 minutes dev	3 minute code gen	3 minute test		1 hour 41 min total

Same as last time, a simple change. For this one, increase the list of 100 words to 200. This was 
not easy! It would require follow-up questions, it would change the look and feel. Unnecessary.
I had it generate code with 200 words, and pasted it to version 6.


version 8	15 minutes dev	0 minute code gen	1 minute test		1 hour 57 min total

Looking at the code, it looked like more than 200 words asked for last time. It was 323 words! Not
bad mind you. I looked at the words. This next change was manually, but really, zero code. I did find
a few words that we not legal (4 different letters; I asked for minimum of 5). I fixed that, and 
combined some good words from 100 that were removed.

Version 8 is release #1


Version 9	22 minutes dev	2 minute code gen	9 minute test		2 hour 30

Looking into this: "I asked for 6-10 letter words. These are in range, but do not appear even
distribution at all. Check.". Here are the proportions
6=>65
7=>241
8=>33
9=>1
10=>2
That is way uneven. To start, I asked for 30 ten-letter words. A couple it created were not words,
and first word had 9 letters. I simply asked it to create again. It took longer, but it created
30, all of them 10-letters. 3 cases were odd words - 27 new words was good enough. I added the
list in the code.
I then asked for 9 letters. This provided a lot of plurals with an S at the end. I deleted quite
a few of these. I added 23 of these words to the code.
This put it in a better spot. 7-letter word still have the most, by far, but there is more balance.
Will add some more 8 letter words, then evaluate. Will need to sort the words. We want to avoid
duplicates (or very similar in place).


Version 10	10 minutes dev	3 minute code gen	4 minute test		2 hour 47

Continuing from the last version, added new 8-letter words. They went easily - came up with 30 
words, no problem. Only one plural - for now I kept it, all 30. We are now up to a very nice
total of 425 words. Had Chat rearrange the order of the initializer array of words in
alphabetical order. I told it to retain all copies. Chat provided the list, which I applied.
The new list had 423 words. I asked it to explain. It said it removed duplicates, and that
is why I only had 423. I want duplicates there - I want to confirm the sort was done correctly.
Later, I'll remove duplicates or close words. Chat confirmed I wanted it copied, keeping all 
425. I did. It ran. The new list had 422. I asked to fix it again. It said that it could not
do it as-is. It offered to provide code based on my JS code for me to run. I did not want to do 
that: it would sort, but then I'd still have to solve the 80-character(-ish) line length. This
was too much effort to lose two words that, keeping real, are likely duplicate.


Version 11	10 minutes dev	0 minute code gen	1 minute test		2 hour 58

Now that words are in sorted order, looking for duplicates or very close words. Got rid of
CONTENT - it has nearly identical letters to CONTEXT; stuck with the later. Had DECISION 
and DECIDE. Got rid of DECIDE - I noticed it broke the rule of at least 5 
different letters. Got rid of double DELIVER, stuck with DELIVERY. Got rid of DEMOCRAT, stuck 
with DEMOCRATIC. DEPARTMENT was duplicated; got rid of DEPART as similar. Got DEVELOP,
DEVELOPED, and DEVELOPING - stuck with the last. DIFFER, DIFFERENCE, DIFFERENT -
went with middle. ECONOMIC also had a plural - got rid of one. EMPLOYEE and EMPLOY -
kept the longer one. GOVERN, GOVERNING, and GOVERNMENT - kept the last one. INCLUDE and 
INCLUDING; kept the later. INCREASED and INCREASING; kept the first. INTEREST had plural -
dropped that. MANAGED and MANAGEMENT, kept that later. OPERATE, OPERATING, OPERATIONS; a
little different and kept the smallest version. STATEMENT has plural: removed plural.
STRUCTURES was duplicated, removed one.
Checking that (and fixing it) didn't take too long, based on the size. Removed 20 words were
removed out of 423, so about 5%. I noticed that the words leaned toward those starting A to E;
lots of words in that range was previously identified and on the TODO list. Also, the temp 
code to count words I left in, comment out. Easy to use when needed on other changes. 


TODO There have been words of different length added for balance. Check again.
TODO Check how often rare letters appear. Some words should lead off and/or contain J, Q, X and Z
TODO The latest 8-letter word addition did all 30 words starting with A to E. Look for distribution
	of lead words; add more to balance out more common starting letters as needed.
TODO For a variety of words, add state names that are one word and fit the rules.
TODO some people like the guesses shown in alpha order. Some like chrono. Support switching; start
	with chrono
TODO some say the green is too bright. Adjust color to be a bit more mild. Just a bit.
