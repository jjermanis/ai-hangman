version 1	8 minute dev	<1 minute code gen	9 minute test		18 minutes total

Notes v1: there are a lot of elements present that I did not specify. The initial game was playable
as-is. 


version 2	4 minute dev	<1 minute code gen	6 minute test		29 minutes total

Issues changed: apparent typo. Says Commodore 64. Intended is Commodore PET.
Issues changed: There are only 6-ish words. I want to add rules for the types of words that can be chosen.
Notes v2: The UI has changed a bit more than expected. I wouldn't expect the 64->PET name change to 
do something like that. For sure I wouldn't expect the word list to affect the UI. Changes are not
massive, but they're not subtle either. There are blocks around the hang post, the word you're guessing,
and the letters you have guessed. The guess has a block AND each letter has a block. I think I need to
be specific about this. It does do the guessed letters in alphabetical order, which I do like.
This also added "press enter to play again" which I like... without prompt mind you.
2nd word was LONGERTHA! That for sure is not a top 5000 word... or a word at all?


version 3	11 minute dev	3 minute code gen	6 minute test		49 minutes total

Issues changed: a lot! I did a restart of the ChatGPT session. I need to add a lot of detail to
get it back to the original look. For truly new details, I ask for guessed letters to be shown
in alphabetical order, and to better lay out the guess letters.
There are some changes to make, but this is very close.

This was quick and easy... but minor. The lineup of the words is centered, both vertically and
horizontally. It is good. Minor UI changes are made... it's the nature of the tool.


TODO the hidden letter spots move on correct guesses. I'd like them to stay in place.
TODO some people like the guesses shown in alpha order. Some like chrono. Support switching; start
	with chrono
