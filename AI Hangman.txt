Create a single-page app in a single HTML file with the following requirements:
- Name: Hangman
- Goal: guess all the hidden letters in the secret word
- the UI is monochrome: black and green. The color are like a Commodore 64 from 1979
- all letters that are printed are in upper case
- the top of the screen is centered as says HANGMAN
- at the left of the screen is a hangman's hook
- at the right are where the hidden letters are shown. Each hidden letter is shown as an underline.
- there is a box at the bottom of the screen. When letters are guessed, you see the letter in the box.
